#1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.
x = 15
y = 30
print(f"The result is {(x+y)/2}")
#2. Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.
a = 20
b = 4
print(f"The sum of the numbers is {a+b}")
print(f"The product of the numbers is {a*b}")
print(f"The subtract of the numbers is {a-b}")
print(f"The divide of the numbers is {a/b}")
print(f"The remainder of the numbers is {a%b}")

#3. Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.
name= "Yamill"
#4. Create three variables in one line and assign each one a different food item
food1, food2, food3 = "Pizza", "Sushi", "Ice Cream"
#5. Print out "Hello" ten times using arithmetic operators.
print("hello word" * 10)
#6. Set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment
name, age = "John", 30
#7. Create two strings and then create a third variable combining both of the two original strings.
string1 = "This is "
string2 = "My house"
string3 = string1 + string2
print(string3)
#8. Create a string and print the fourth letter of the word.
string4 = "Rakatuka"
print(string4[4])
#9. Create a string and print the letters from index 0 to 5.
string5 = "Rakatuka"
print(string5[0:5])
#10. Create a variable and print all the letters from the first index until the end.
my_string = "Hello, World!"
# Print all letters from the first index until the end
print(my_string[0:])
